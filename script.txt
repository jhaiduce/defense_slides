Hi, I John Haiducek and I'm a grad student at the University of Michigan. I'm going to talk today about my dissertation research which is on magnetohydrodynamic modeling of magnetospheric substorms. That sounds like a mouthful so I'm going to break it down a bit. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is a method for simulating the motion of a plasma. Among other things it's useful for simulating the magnetosphere, which is the region where the plasma in space is affected by the presence of the Earth. The picture on my title slide here shows the magnetosphere in one of my MHD simulations. The Earth would here, and the Sun would be somewhere over that way. The magnetic field lines from the Earth get pushed back because of the solar wind, forming what we call the "magnetotail" or just "tail." In the tail we also have a bunch of coiled-up field lines, called a flux rope or plasmoid. That's part of what we call a "substorm." Now, we know that these substorms occur both in observations and in MHD simulations, and my objective is to find out how well the model agrees with observations---how often do model substorms occur at the same time as the observed ones?

The first place that substorms were observed is in the aurora. Energetic particles from space excite atoms in the atmosphere and cause them to emit red and green light. You all have probably seen this yourselves. This movie shows observations of a substorm from ground-based cameras. But to really understand what is causing this you have to look at the solar wind and how it affects the magnetosphere.

The solar wind is a stream of particles that continually flows out from the sun. When it arrives at Earth, a process known as reconnection happens, which allows energy from the solar wind to enter the magnetosphere.
